## NutriCalc

NutriCalc is a free, single page web application designed for the use of dieticians and nutritionists.
Designed using React and Javascript, NutriCalc is quick and easy, rendering information as you input.

## Instructions

Input the patient information into the calculator to show Caloric Needs -- (Mifflin St. Joer or Simplified) -- of the patient.
Select the tabs for the information desired.

## Cool Stuff
Unit Conversion - With a click of a button, you can convert the information presented from Imperial to Metric system or vice versa.
Validated Inputs - Specified input values so that user is less likely to put in invalid inputs such as letters into a numerical field.
Upper and Lower Bounds - Is there ever someone older than 200? Specified numerical inputs to reduce input errors. After all, it isn't likely for someone to weigh over a ton.

## Future implementation
Backend to store patient data
